## ðŸ’¡ My CS Inspiration  
When I was posted to a geriatric ward during my work experience programme at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, I was surprised by the advancement of computing techniques used in the medical field to ensure a clear and effective record and tracking of a patientâ€™s medical condition. Besides this, a senior nurse expressed her hope that we, as JC students, can suggest better ideas to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of technological installations like fall sensors, especially in geriatric wards where extra care by nurse and doctor is expected to meet the special request of patients. Although so far, I have not come up with a very clear idea about the improvement, I feel encouraged and motivated to explore areas of computer science and Artificial Intelligence that can make a difference in the coming ageing society.
